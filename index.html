		<h2>Creating Games</h2>
		<p>Hi, My name is Aditya and My favourite hobby is Creating Games through code. I use a game engine called Unity, to design and make high quality animations, effects and characters. It is a 3d platform for game devs. You can make really good games if you know the basic rules of physics and art. Then I use Visual Studio as my coding script to write in my code. I use the language of C#, pronounced as C Sharp. I haven't really learnt about this in my coding classes but I got the hang of it. It is similar to JavaScript. Unity is very handy and I really like it. C# is Capital Sensitive so even one place that doesn't include capital will be an error. I have made many games and published them on Steam(Gaming Platform). One of my Games, I made with some of my friends is called Karlson which is 13th on the most added to wishlist. That's All! I even Have a full on trailer which my Uncle made.
